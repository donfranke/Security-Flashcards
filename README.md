# Security-Flashcards
## Companion to the book Cyber Security Basics by Don Franke, available at Amazon.com.
This is a list of security terms currently available for the Security Flashcards Alexa skill. I plan to continue to add to this list. As a study aid, consider trying to define a term, then ask Alexa for the definition to see if they match.
## To run the skill
1. You need an Amazon Echo device
2. Install the Security Flashcards Alexa skill
3. Say `launch Security Flashcards` to run
